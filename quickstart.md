There are 2 version of `Themaphack` with different use cases, the virtual & external version

## Virtual version

Uses apk virtualization and obfuscated code to ensure security between modmenu and game client make it **`more safest and stable without lag/crash`**

* We dont open source the code at this version.
* In-game microphone not work but you can use discord instead.
* Stable and safe, i reach **`Immortal`** using this version.

## External version

This version is the outcome of compiling [source code](https://github.com/anggorodhanumurti/themaphack) in a form of `.so files` which is injected into mlbb folder. 

No encryption nor obfuscated code so you can customize its feature and function to suit your needs, **but it's easy to detect**

* Support in-game microphone
* Plug n play, no need to clone apk or redownload data just extract and ready to play
* Read **INSTALL.txt** inside `tmhv1.1.4-external-64bit.zip` for install instruction

## Installation & usage

We recommend you to use [`TMH virtual`](https://github.com/anggorodhanumurti/themaphack/releases/tag/v2.0-virtual(allstar-64bit)) because it is safer and more stable than the external version.
