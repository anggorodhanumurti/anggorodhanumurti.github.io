There are 2 version of `Themaphack` with different use cases, the virtual & [external version](https://themaphack.com/build)

## Virtual version

Uses apk virtualization and obfuscated code to ensure security between modmenu and game client make it **`more safest and stable without lag/crash`**

* We dont open source the code at this version.
* In-game microphone not work but you can use discord instead.
* Stable and safe, i reach **`Immortal`** using this version.

## Installation & usage

We recommend you to use [`TMH virtual`](https://github.com/anggorodhanumurti/themaphack/releases/tag/v2.0-virtual(allstar-64bit)) because it is **`safer and more stable than the external version`**

1. Extract `tmhv2.0_virtual_allstar_64bit.zip` then install `NovaLauncher_patch_allstar.apk`

2. Open `Nova Launcher` click `Start` allow permission for `Nova Launcher` to manage all files

3. Makesure you have installed latest mlbb from playstore and downloaded all data 100%. Then add `mlbb` to `Nova Launcher` by Selecting `Mobile Legends` then click **`Clone`**
