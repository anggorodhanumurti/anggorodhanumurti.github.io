A high-contrast black and white photo taken in a modern art gallery.
The scene captures a candid or "stolen shot" style moment of a young man like (my attach picture) without changing his real face standing still among a crowd in motion. 

He is positioned at a slight slanted angle, not fully side view with face turned slightly-not completely facing the camera, but also not fully sideways. 

Framing is from mid-thigh upward (3/4 body shot). He is wearing a photochromic sunglasses and long dark coat with hands in his pockets, standing out from the blurred crowd moving past him. 

The background wall displays framed. Banksy artworks in a grid arrengement, slightly blurred for depth. 

The mood is moody, cinematic and introspective.
